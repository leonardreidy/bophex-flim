Bophex Flim
==============

This project takes Rukano's Aphex Flim Generator as it's point of departure. It is not, however, a fork. 
The goal is to use Rukano's project as a point of departure for thinking about and building useful SuperCollider 
projects for composing and performing music. If you want to take a look at the original unfinished repo click
